        "text": "Upload File A simple form to upload AIS documents (AIP, amendments, supplements, AICs) so the AIS team can publish them. Step-by-step (what to do) Select a Category:  Choose one of: AIP  — full AIP parts and chapters AMDT  — amendment to existing AIP material SUP  — supplement (choose Bravo/Charlie series) AIC  — aeronautical information circular If you chose  SUP :  pick a Path Name (Bravo or Charlie). If you chose  AIP :  pick a Part (Part 1 = GEN, Part 2 = ENR, Part 3 = AD) then choose the Chapter/Number. Some Part 3 (AD) selections show extra sub‑choices (e.g., INTERNATIONAL, MILITARY). Subsection:  Short identifier or subsection name (required). Title:  Full title of the document. (For AMDT, include the effective date in the title if needed.) Batch Date Reference (optional):  Pick a CURRENT or UPCOMING batch to auto-fill Publication and Effectivity dates, or leave blank to enter those dates manually. Publication Date & Effectivity Date:  Enter when the document is published and when it becomes effective (required). Expiration Type:  Choose: Self-Expiratory  — you must enter an End Date. PERM  — permanent; no end date. The form will show/hide the End Date field based on this choice. Upload PDF:  Attach the document as a PDF only (.pdf). This is required. Submit Document:  Click the Submit button; a success message appears if upload completes. Quick tips Use a Batch Date to avoid manual date entry errors. For AIP uploads, confirm you picked the right Part and Chapter to keep documents organized. Double-check expiration dates if the document should expire (Self-Expiratory). Ensure your file is a PDF and not password-protected. AIS Document Upload: Best Practices & Troubleshooting A. Category Selection Always select the correct  Category : AIP, AMDT, SUP, or AIC. Double-check the category before submitting. Example: SUP for Supplements, AIC for Circulars. B. Title Field The  Title  must clearly identify the document and its type. For AIC: Always include \"AIC\" in the title. Example:  AIC 002/26 AIRAC SYSTEM/AMENDMENTS TO AIP PHILIPPINES FOR YEAR 2025 For SUP: Include \"SUP\" in the title. Example:  001/26 CHECKLIST OF AIP SUPPLEMENTS For AMDT: Example:  AIRAC AIP AMDT 001/26 22 JAN 26 For AIP: Example:  GEN 1.2 ENTRY, TRANSIT AND DEPARTURE OF AIRCRAFT  |   ENR 1.1 GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES  |   AD 1.1 AERODROME/HELIPORT AVAILABILITY AND CONDITIONS OF USE  |   AD RPSP BOHOL-PANGLAO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT  |  AD RPVB BACOLOD PRINCIPAL AIRPORT (CLASS 1)  |   AD RPVS ANTIQUE PRINCIPAL AIRPORT (CLASS 2 ) |  AD RPLY ALABAT COMMUNITY AIRPORT  |  AD RPML CAGAYAN DE ORO (MILITARY)  C. Subsection Field Use a unique and descriptive subsection name. Avoid generic names like \"Update\" or \"Notice\". D. Category-Specific Fields For SUP: Select the correct path (Bravo/Charlie). For AIP: Select the correct Part and Chapter. For AD Part 3, Chapter 2: Select the correct Sub Chapter (e.g., INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPAL - CLASS 1). E. Category/Chapter Consistency Ensure the  category ,  chapter , and  sub chapter  match the document’s content and intended audience. Common Issues & Solutions Issue 1: File Not Displaying for SUP (or AIC) Due to Duplicate Title Cause:  Two files with the same title, one in SUP and one in AIC, but the AIC file does not have \"AIC\" in the title. Solution: Always include the category (e.g., \"AIC\", \"SUP\") in the title. If a file is missing, check for duplicate titles across categories. Rename the title to include the correct category and re-upload if needed. Issue 2: Incorrect Category or Sub Chapter (e.g., RPVM assigned to Principal Class 1 instead of International) Cause:  File uploaded to the wrong sub chapter/category. Solution: Archive or delete the incorrectly categorized file. Re-upload the file under the correct category/sub chapter. Ensure the title and sub chapter match the document’s actual content. Issue 3: File with Same Title Still Showing (Old File Not Expired) Cause:  System displays the most recent non-expired file with a given title. Solution: Archive or set the old file to expired if it’s in the wrong category. If archiving is not possible, delete the old file before re-uploading. Always check the expiration date and status of existing files before uploading a new one with the same title. Issue 4: Overwriting or Replacing Files Best Practice: Never upload a new file with the same title and category unless you intend to replace the old one. If a correction is needed, archive or expire the old file first. Issue 5: Incorrect Date Fields Solution: Ensure publication and effectivity dates are correct and in the future. For self-expiratory files, the expiration date must be after the effectivity date. Preventive Measures Always double-check all fields before submitting. Use unique, descriptive titles that include the category. Archive or expire old/incorrect files before uploading corrections. For corrections, do not just re-upload—ensure the old file is not active. If unsure, consult this guide or contact the system administrator. Example Table: Correct Input Formats Category Title Example Subsection Example Sub Chapter Example SUP SUP 02/2026 - Runway Closure Taxiway Alpha (N/A) AIC AIC 01/2026 - RPVM International Procedures RPVM INTERNATIONAL AMDT AMDT 03/2026 - Chart Update GEN 1.2 (N/A) AIP AIP GEN 1.2 - Definitions GEN 1.2 (N/A) Additional Possible Issues & Solutions Uploading a file with a typo in the title: Solution: Delete or archive the file, correct the title, and re-upload. Uploading to the wrong effective date: Solution: Archive/delete the file and re-upload with the correct date. Uploading a file with the wrong PDF: Solution: Archive/delete the file and re-upload with the correct document. Quick Checklist Before Upload  Correct category selected  Title includes category and is unique  Subsection and sub chapter are accurate  Dates are correct and valid  No duplicate active files with the same title/category"

    "/AIP-Documentation/documentation/archives/": {
        "title": "Archives",
        "text": "Archives A simple interface to view and restore archived AIP documents (AIP, AMDT, SUP, AIC) so AIS staff can retrieve and unarchive previously archived files. What you see - A filter dropdown to show all categories or only one category (AIP, AMDT, SUP, AIC). - A color legend showing which color matches each category (blue = AIP, green = AMDT, yellow = SUP, red = AIC). - A table of archived files with columns:   -  Label  — the document name/subsection   -  Category  — the document type (with a colored dot)   -  Issuance Date  — the document’s issuance/effective date   -  Access PDF  — actions:  View PDF  (open file) and  Unarchive  (restore file) Step-by-step (How to use it) 1. Open the Archives page from the AIP dashboard. 2. Use  Filter by Category  to narrow the list to a specific type (optional). 3. Click a column header to sort the table by that column. The page defaults to sorting by  Issuance Date  (newest first). 4. To view a document, click  View PDF  — the PDF opens in a new tab from storage. 5. To restore a file back to active lists, click  Unarchive ; this sends a request to the server to toggle the archive status. Quick tips - Use the filter to reduce the list if the archive is large. - After unarchiving, check the AIP dashboard or relevant module to confirm the file is back in the active list. - If a PDF does not open, the file may be missing from storage or the storage link may be incorrect."

    "/AIP-Documentation/documentation/view-file/": {
        "title": "View File",
        "text": "View File A page for AIS editors to view a document's PDF, update its metadata (title, subsection, dates), replace the PDF file, expire a document, or reactivate an expired document. What you see - A form titled  Update Document  showing the document's current details: ID, Section (category), Subsection (file name), Title, Publication Date, Effective Date, Expiration Type, and Expiration Date (if applicable). - Buttons:  Update Document ,  Supersede File ,  Expire  or  Reactivate  depending on current status. - Two confirmation modals: one to confirm expiring a document, and one to confirm reactivating an expired document. - A PDF viewer below the form where the stored PDF opens inside an iframe. Step-by-step (what to do) 1. Review current values shown (ID, Section, Subsection, Title, dates). 2. Edit text fields if you need to change the Subsection (`file_name`) or Title (`file_subject`). 3. Adjust dates:    - `Publication Date` and `Effective Date` are editable with `datetime-local` inputs.    - `Expiration Type` can be `PERM` (permanent) or `Self-Expiratory` (requires an End Date).    - If `Self-Expiratory` is selected, enter an `Expiration Date` (UTC-aware). 4. Replace the PDF by using the  Replace File  upload input (accepts `.pdf`). 5. Click  Update Document  to save changes. 6. Use  Supersede File  to create a new version (keeps previous revision history). 7. To expire a non-expired document, click  Expire  and confirm in the modal. 8. To reactivate an expired document, click  Reactivate  — a modal will warn you if the document uses `Self-Expiratory`. You must set an expiration date in the future (UTC) when reactivating if required, then confirm. Quick tips - Double-check UTC notices before entering expiration dates — the server treats the inputs as UTC. - Use  Supersede File  when you need a new version while keeping the old one archived or referenced. - After update or reactivate, verify the document appears correctly in the dashboard or relevant listing."
