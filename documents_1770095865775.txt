        "title": "Upload File",
        "text": "Upload File A simple form to upload AIS documents (AIP, amendments, supplements, AICs) so the AIS team can publish them. Step-by-step (what to do) Select a Category:  Choose one of: AIP  — full AIP parts and chapters AMDT  — amendment to existing AIP material SUP  — supplement (choose Bravo/Charlie series) AIC  — aeronautical information circular If you chose  SUP :  pick a Path Name (Bravo or Charlie). If you chose  AIP :  pick a Part (Part 1 = GEN, Part 2 = ENR, Part 3 = AD) then choose the Chapter/Number. Some Part 3 (AD) selections show extra sub‑choices (e.g., INTERNATIONAL, MILITARY). Subsection:  Short identifier or subsection name (required). Title:  Full title of the document. (For AMDT, include the effective date in the title if needed.) Batch Date Reference (optional):  Pick a CURRENT or UPCOMING batch to auto-fill Publication and Effectivity dates, or leave blank to enter those dates manually. Publication Date & Effectivity Date:  Enter when the document is published and when it becomes effective (required). Expiration Type:  Choose: Self-Expiratory  — you must enter an End Date. PERM  — permanent; no end date. The form will show/hide the End Date field based on this choice. Upload PDF:  Attach the document as a PDF only (.pdf). This is required. Submit Document:  Click the Submit button; a success message appears if upload completes. Quick tips Use a Batch Date to avoid manual date entry errors. For AIP uploads, confirm you picked the right Part and Chapter to keep documents organized. Double-check expiration dates if the document should expire (Self-Expiratory). Ensure your file is a PDF and not password-protected."

    "/AIP-Documentation/documentation/archives/": {
        "title": "Archives",
        "text": "Archives A simple interface to view and restore archived AIP documents (AIP, AMDT, SUP, AIC) so AIS staff can retrieve and unarchive previously archived files. What you see - A filter dropdown to show all categories or only one category (AIP, AMDT, SUP, AIC). - A color legend showing which color matches each category (blue = AIP, green = AMDT, yellow = SUP, red = AIC). - A table of archived files with columns:   -  Label  — the document name/subsection   -  Category  — the document type (with a colored dot)   -  Issuance Date  — the document’s issuance/effective date   -  Access PDF  — actions:  View PDF  (open file) and  Unarchive  (restore file) Step-by-step (How to use it) 1. Open the Archives page from the AIP dashboard. 2. Use  Filter by Category  to narrow the list to a specific type (optional). 3. Click a column header to sort the table by that column. The page defaults to sorting by  Issuance Date  (newest first). 4. To view a document, click  View PDF  — the PDF opens in a new tab from storage. 5. To restore a file back to active lists, click  Unarchive ; this sends a request to the server to toggle the archive status. Quick tips - Use the filter to reduce the list if the archive is large. - After unarchiving, check the AIP dashboard or relevant module to confirm the file is back in the active list. - If a PDF does not open, the file may be missing from storage or the storage link may be incorrect."

        "title": "View File",
        "text": "View File A page for AIS editors to view a document's PDF, update its metadata (title, subsection, dates), replace the PDF file, expire a document, or reactivate an expired document. What you see - A form titled  Update Document  showing the document's current details: ID, Section (category), Subsection (file name), Title, Publication Date, Effective Date, Expiration Type, and Expiration Date (if applicable). - Buttons:  Update Document ,  Supersede File ,  Expire  or  Reactivate  depending on current status. - Two confirmation modals: one to confirm expiring a document, and one to confirm reactivating an expired document. - A PDF viewer below the form where the stored PDF opens inside an iframe. Step-by-step (what to do) 1. Review current values shown (ID, Section, Subsection, Title, dates). 2. Edit text fields if you need to change the Subsection (`file_name`) or Title (`file_subject`). 3. Adjust dates:    - `Publication Date` and `Effective Date` are editable with `datetime-local` inputs.    - `Expiration Type` can be `PERM` (permanent) or `Self-Expiratory` (requires an End Date).    - If `Self-Expiratory` is selected, enter an `Expiration Date` (UTC-aware). 4. Replace the PDF by using the  Replace File  upload input (accepts `.pdf`). 5. Click  Update Document  to save changes. 6. Use  Supersede File  to create a new version (keeps previous revision history). 7. To expire a non-expired document, click  Expire  and confirm in the modal. 8. To reactivate an expired document, click  Reactivate  — a modal will warn you if the document uses `Self-Expiratory`. You must set an expiration date in the future (UTC) when reactivating if required, then confirm. Quick tips - Double-check UTC notices before entering expiration dates — the server treats the inputs as UTC. - Use  Supersede File  when you need a new version while keeping the old one archived or referenced. - After update or reactivate, verify the document appears correctly in the dashboard or relevant listing."
